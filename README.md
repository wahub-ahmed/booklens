This site will be a site that houses tens of thousands of books and their subsequent reviews that were found on Amazon. With this data, we hope to make a nice looking prohect that uses our knowledge of databases and SQL to create a clean and responsive website to display our data effectively. In this site, it will be possible to look up all of the reviews for each book as well as create reviews that users want to write based on certain books they have read. A more detailed outline of what we hope to put into the website will be found in the Milestone 3 document. 


Update for Milestone 3: In the directions for Milestone 3 it says to update our progress for the TA to see. In terms of progress all we have done so far is what was asked of us for Milestone 3 which was the queries, cleaning our data, putting this data into DataGrip as well as the tasks that were asked of us in the email sent to us regarding feedback for Milestone 2. We will soon start working on the Backend of the project as required for Milestone 4.
